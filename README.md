##Description
Minecraft: Pi Edition contains a really simple, but surprisingly versatile API that allows programmers to interact with the Minecraft world in real time using code. Since its release functions of tthe api have been migrated to other Minecraft implementations (e.g. Bukkit, Canarymod, Forge) and also extended.

Its objective is to document the api and be a reference point to ensure consistency.

This repository:
* describes the api, its derivatives and its extentions
* provides information about compatibility across versions
* holds the language specific (e.g. python, java) modules which allow programmers to access the api and its extensions
