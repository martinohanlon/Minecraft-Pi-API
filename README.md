## Description
Minecraft: Pi Edition contains a really simple, but surprisingly versatile API that allows programmers to interact with the Minecraft world in real time using code. 

Since its release the api has been migrated to other Minecraft implementations (e.g. Bukkit, Canarymod, Forge) as well as being extended

The objective of this repository is to document the api and be a reference point to ensure consistency across the implementation as well as providing a basis of discussion.

This repository:
* describes the api, its derivatives and its extentions
* provides information about compatibility across versions
* holds the language specific (e.g. python, java) modules which allow programmers to access the api and its extensions

## Implementations
